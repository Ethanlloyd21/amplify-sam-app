# AMPLIFY + AWS SAM APPLICATION

Hello! Welcome to the Amplify + AWS SAM Full Stack Application project.

This project is aimed at providing a comprehensive guide and structure to build a full-stack application using AWS Amplify and AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). We leverage the powerful features of these services to create a scalable, secure, and easily maintainable web application.

## About the project

AWS Amplify enables developers to develop and deploy cloud-powered mobile and web applications. It includes a broad set of tools and services that can create scalable, full stack applications, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way of defining the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by your serverless application.

The combination of Amplify and AWS SAM allows developers to rapidly build and scale applications without worrying about managing servers. This project provides a ready-to-use template to bootstrap your next full stack application.

## Project structure

The project is divided into two main sections:

1. Frontend (Amplify): This is where we design our user interfaces, authenticate users, manage user state, and interact with our backend resources. The frontend part is handled by AWS Amplify. [https://github.com/Ethanlloyd21/amplify-sam-app]

2. Backend (AWS SAM): This includes serverless functions (Lambda), API endpoints (API Gateway), and data storage (DynamoDB). The backend is managed using AWS SAM. [https://github.com/Ethanlloyd21/amplify-sam-app-backend]

## Pre-requisite:
1. Install Node.js
2. AWS account
3. Install AWS CLI
4. Install AWS SAM
5. Install Docker (optional)
